# Module ogc_api_client.rest

A sample API conforming to the OGC API - Processes - Part 1 standard

This document is an API definition document provided alongside the OGC API - Processes standard. The OGC API - Processes Standard specifies a processing interface to communicate over a RESTful protocol using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) encodings. The specification allows for the wrapping of computational tasks into executable processes that can be offered by a server and be invoked by a client application.

### RESTResponse

```python3
class RESTResponse(
    resp
)
```

The abstract base class for all I/O classes.

This class provides dummy implementations for many methods that
derived classes can override selectively; the default implementations
represent a file that cannot be read, written or seeked.

Even though IOBase does not declare read, readinto, or write because
their signatures will vary, implementations and clients should
consider those methods part of the interface. Also, implementations
may raise UnsupportedOperation when operations they do not support are
called.

The basic type used for binary data read from or written to a file is
bytes. Other bytes-like objects are accepted as method arguments too.
In some cases (such as readinto), a writable object is required. Text
I/O classes work with str data.

Note that calling any method (except additional calls to close(),
which are ignored) on a closed stream should raise a ValueError.

IOBase (and its subclasses) support the iterator protocol, meaning
that an IOBase object can be iterated over yielding the lines in a
stream.

IOBase also supports the :keyword:`with` statement. In this example,
fp is closed after the suite of the with statement is complete:

with open('spam.txt', 'r') as fp:
    fp.write('Spam and eggs!')

#### Class variables

```python3
closed
```

#### Methods

    
#### close

```python3
def close(
    self,
    /
)
```

Flush and close the IO object.

This method has no effect if the file is already closed.

    
#### fileno

```python3
def fileno(
    self,
    /
)
```

Return underlying file descriptor if one exists.

Raise OSError if the IO object does not use a file descriptor.

    
#### flush

```python3
def flush(
    self,
    /
)
```

Flush write buffers, if applicable.

This is not implemented for read-only and non-blocking streams.

    
#### getheader

```python3
def getheader(
    self,
    name,
    default=None
)
```

Returns a given response header.

    
#### getheaders

```python3
def getheaders(
    self
)
```

Returns a dictionary of the response headers.

    
#### isatty

```python3
def isatty(
    self,
    /
)
```

Return whether this is an 'interactive' stream.

Return False if it can't be determined.

    
#### read

```python3
def read(
    self
)
```

    
#### readable

```python3
def readable(
    self,
    /
)
```

Return whether object was opened for reading.

If False, read() will raise OSError.

    
#### readline

```python3
def readline(
    self,
    size=-1,
    /
)
```

Read and return a line from the stream.

If size is specified, at most size bytes will be read.

The line terminator is always b'\n' for binary files; for text
files, the newlines argument to open can be used to select the line
terminator(s) recognized.

    
#### readlines

```python3
def readlines(
    self,
    hint=-1,
    /
)
```

Return a list of lines from the stream.

hint can be specified to control the number of lines read: no more
lines will be read if the total size (in bytes/characters) of all
lines so far exceeds hint.

    
#### seek

```python3
def seek(
    self,
    offset,
    whence=0,
    /
)
```

Change the stream position to the given byte offset.

offset
    The stream position, relative to 'whence'.
  whence
    The relative position to seek from.

The offset is interpreted relative to the position indicated by whence.
Values for whence are:

* os.SEEK_SET or 0 -- start of stream (the default); offset should be zero or positive
* os.SEEK_CUR or 1 -- current stream position; offset may be negative
* os.SEEK_END or 2 -- end of stream; offset is usually negative

Return the new absolute position.

    
#### seekable

```python3
def seekable(
    self,
    /
)
```

Return whether object supports random access.

If False, seek(), tell() and truncate() will raise OSError.
This method may need to do a test seek().

    
#### tell

```python3
def tell(
    self,
    /
)
```

Return current stream position.

    
#### truncate

```python3
def truncate(
    self,
    size=None,
    /
)
```

Truncate file to size bytes.

File pointer is left unchanged. Size defaults to the current IO position
as reported by tell(). Return the new size.

    
#### writable

```python3
def writable(
    self,
    /
)
```

Return whether object was opened for writing.

If False, write() will raise OSError.

    
#### writelines

```python3
def writelines(
    self,
    lines,
    /
)
```

Write a list of lines to stream.

Line separators are not added, so it is usual for each of the
lines provided to have a line separator at the end.

### RESTResponseType

```python3
class RESTResponseType(
    body: '_TYPE_BODY' = '',
    headers: 'typing.Mapping[str, str] | typing.Mapping[bytes, bytes] | None' = None,
    status: 'int' = 0,
    version: 'int' = 0,
    version_string: 'str' = 'HTTP/?',
    reason: 'str | None' = None,
    preload_content: 'bool' = True,
    decode_content: 'bool' = True,
    original_response: '_HttplibHTTPResponse | None' = None,
    pool: 'HTTPConnectionPool | None' = None,
    connection: 'HTTPConnection | None' = None,
    msg: '_HttplibHTTPMessage | None' = None,
    retries: 'Retry | None' = None,
    enforce_content_length: 'bool' = True,
    request_method: 'str | None' = None,
    request_url: 'str | None' = None,
    auto_close: 'bool' = True,
    sock_shutdown: 'typing.Callable[[int], None] | None' = None
)
```

HTTP Response container.

Backwards-compatible with :class:`http.client.HTTPResponse` but the response ``body`` is
loaded and decoded on-demand when the ``data`` property is accessed.  This
class is also compatible with the Python standard library's :mod:`io`
module, and can hence be treated as a readable object in the context of that
framework.

Extra parameters for behaviour not present in :class:`http.client.HTTPResponse`:
#### Attributes

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| preload_content | None | If True, the response's body will be preloaded during construction. | None |
| decode_content | None | If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the<br>'content-encoding' header. | None |
| original_response | None | When this HTTPResponse wrapper is generated from an :class:`http.client.HTTPResponse`<br>object, it's convenient to include the original for debug purposes. It's<br>otherwise unused. | None |
| retries | None | The retries contains the last :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` that<br>was used during the request. | None |
| enforce_content_length | None | Enforce content length checking. Body returned by server must match<br>value of Content-Length header, if present. Otherwise, raise error. | None |

#### Ancestors (in MRO)

```python3
url
```

If the request that generated this response redirected, this method
will return the final redirect location.

#### Methods

    
#### close

```python3
def close(
    self
) -> 'None'
```

Flush and close the IO object.

This method has no effect if the file is already closed.

    
#### drain_conn

```python3
def drain_conn(
    self
) -> 'None'
```

Read and discard any remaining HTTP response data in the response connection.

Unread data in the HTTPResponse connection blocks the connection from being released back to the pool.

    
#### fileno

```python3
def fileno(
    self
) -> 'int'
```

Return underlying file descriptor if one exists.

Raise OSError if the IO object does not use a file descriptor.

    
#### flush

```python3
def flush(
    self
) -> 'None'
```

Flush write buffers, if applicable.

This is not implemented for read-only and non-blocking streams.

    
#### get_redirect_location

```python3
def get_redirect_location(
    self
) -> 'str | None | typing.Literal[False]'
```

Should we redirect and where to?

**Returns:**

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| None | Truthy redirect location string if we got a redirect status<br>code and valid location. ``None`` if redirect status and no<br>location. ``False`` if not a redirect status code. |

    
#### getheader

```python3
def getheader(
    self,
    name: 'str',
    default: 'str | None' = None
) -> 'str | None'
```

    
#### getheaders

```python3
def getheaders(
    self
) -> 'HTTPHeaderDict'
```

    
#### geturl

```python3
def geturl(
    self
) -> 'str | None'
```

    
#### info

```python3
def info(
    self
) -> 'HTTPHeaderDict'
```

    
#### isatty

```python3
def isatty(
    self,
    /
)
```

Return whether this is an 'interactive' stream.

Return False if it can't be determined.

    
#### isclosed

```python3
def isclosed(
    self
) -> 'bool'
```

    
#### json

```python3
def json(
    self
) -> 'typing.Any'
```

Deserializes the body of the HTTP response as a Python object.

The body of the HTTP response must be encoded using UTF-8, as per
`RFC 8529 Section 8.1 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8259#section-8.1>`_.

To use a custom JSON decoder pass the result of :attr:`HTTPResponse.data` to
your custom decoder instead.

If the body of the HTTP response is not decodable to UTF-8, a
`UnicodeDecodeError` will be raised. If the body of the HTTP response is not a
valid JSON document, a `json.JSONDecodeError` will be raised.

Read more :ref:`here <json_content>`.

**Returns:**

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| None | The body of the HTTP response as a Python object. |

    
#### read

```python3
def read(
    self,
    amt: 'int | None' = None,
    decode_content: 'bool | None' = None,
    cache_content: 'bool' = False
) -> 'bytes'
```

Similar to :meth:`http.client.HTTPResponse.read`, but with two additional

parameters: ``decode_content`` and ``cache_content``.

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| amt | None | How much of the content to read. If specified, caching is skipped<br>because it doesn't make sense to cache partial content as the full<br>response. | None |
| decode_content | None | If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the<br>'content-encoding' header. | None |
| cache_content | None | If True, will save the returned data such that the same result is<br>returned despite of the state of the underlying file object. This<br>is useful if you want the ``.data`` property to continue working<br>after having ``.read()`` the file object. (Overridden if ``amt`` is<br>set.) | None |

    
#### read1

```python3
def read1(
    self,
    amt: 'int | None' = None,
    decode_content: 'bool | None' = None
) -> 'bytes'
```

Similar to ``http.client.HTTPResponse.read1`` and documented

in :meth:`io.BufferedReader.read1`, but with an additional parameter:
``decode_content``.

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| amt | None | How much of the content to read. | None |
| decode_content | None | If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the<br>'content-encoding' header. | None |

    
#### read_chunked

```python3
def read_chunked(
    self,
    amt: 'int | None' = None,
    decode_content: 'bool | None' = None
) -> 'typing.Generator[bytes]'
```

Similar to :meth:`HTTPResponse.read`, but with an additional

parameter: ``decode_content``.

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| amt | None | How much of the content to read. If specified, caching is skipped<br>because it doesn't make sense to cache partial content as the full<br>response. | None |
| decode_content | None | If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the<br>'content-encoding' header. | None |

    
#### readable

```python3
def readable(

```

    
#### readline

```python3
def readline(

    size=-1,
    /
)
```

Read and return a line from the stream.

def release_conn(
    self
) -> 'None'
```

    
#### seek

```python3
def seek(
    self,
    offset,
    whence=0,
    /
)
```

Change the stream position to the given byte offset.

offset
    The stream position, relative to 'whence'.
  whence
    The relative position to seek from.

The offset is interpreted relative to the position indicated by whence.
Values for whence are:

* os.SEEK_SET or 0 -- start of stream (the default); offset should be zero or positive
* os.SEEK_CUR or 1 -- current stream position; offset may be negative
* os.SEEK_END or 2 -- end of stream; offset is usually negative

Return the new absolute position.

    
#### seekable

```python3
def seekable(
    self,
    /
)
```

Return whether object supports random access.

If False, seek(), tell() and truncate() will raise OSError.
This method may need to do a test seek().

    
#### shutdown

```python3

    amt: 'int | None' = 65536,
    decode_content: 'bool | None' = None
) -> 'typing.Generator[bytes]'
```

A generator wrapper for the read() method. A call will block until

``amt`` bytes have been read from the connection or until the
connection is closed.

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| amt | None | How much of the content to read. The generator will return up to<br>much data per iteration, but may return less. This is particularly<br>likely when using compressed data. However, the empty string will<br>never be returned. | None |
| decode_content | None | If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the<br>'content-encoding' header. | None |

    
#### supports_chunked_reads

```python3
def supports_chunked_reads(
    self
) -> 'bool'
```

Checks if the underlying file-like object looks like a

    
#### tell

```python3
def tell(
    self
) -> 'int'
```

Obtain the number of bytes pulled over the wire so far. May differ from

the amount of content returned by :meth:``urllib3.response.HTTPResponse.read``
if bytes are encoded on the wire (e.g, compressed).

    
#### truncate

```python3
def truncate(
    self,
    size=None,
