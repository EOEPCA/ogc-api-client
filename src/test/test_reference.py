    A sample API conforming to the OGC API - Processes - Part 1 standard

    This document is an API definition document provided alongside the OGC API - Processes standard. The OGC API - Processes Standard specifies a processing interface to communicate over a RESTful protocol using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) encodings. The specification allows for the wrapping of computational tasks into executable processes that can be offered by a server and be invoked by a client application.
